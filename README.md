I am a solo dev studying Game Development. This is a personal project for practicing OOP.
The goal is to build a basic yet easily modifaible framework for future role playing games systems.
If there are any glaring issues or suggestions, feel free to make a pull request.
I try to make adjustments to / refine the project at least once a week.
